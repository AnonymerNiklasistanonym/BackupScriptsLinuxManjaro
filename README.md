# BackupScriptsLinuxManjaro

Scripts with which you can easily backup data on Linux PCs (Manjaro 18.1 in this case).

- [`backup_home_directory.sh`](backup_home_directory.sh) uses `rsync` to backup a (for example the home) directory
- [`get_installed_programs_pacman.sh`](get_installed_programs_pacman.sh) reads explicitly installed `pacman` packages and converts them into a `.csv` file
